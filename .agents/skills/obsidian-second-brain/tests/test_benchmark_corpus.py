"""A benchmark that grades itself wrong is worse than no benchmark.

The first version of the generator wrote "<title> is <gloss>." into each
canonical note, and the gloss is exactly the text of that note's paraphrase
query. So every paraphrase query appeared verbatim inside its own answer, and
pure lexical search scored 83% on a set specifically designed to defeat lexical
search. It looked like a strong result. It was the answer key.

That is the failure mode these tests exist for: not "does the generator run"
but "does the corpus actually measure the thing it claims to". So they check
that queries do not leak into their answers, that the intended difficulty is
really present, and that two people running this get the same corpus, without
which no two numbers are comparable.
