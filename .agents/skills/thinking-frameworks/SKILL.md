  Apply 180+ thinking frameworks to any problem. Use when analyzing, deciding, strategizing,
  brainstorming, evaluating evidence, designing solutions, or coaching others through structured
  thinking. Covers mental models, decision-making, strategy, creativity, systems thinking,
  cognitive biases, and more — organized into 15 categories with guidance on when to use each.
  DO NOT use for domain-specific BASF workflows; use dedicated BASF skills instead.

# 🧠 Thinking Frameworks

A comprehensive toolkit of **180 thinking frameworks** across 15 categories. Use this skill whenever you need to apply structured thinking to a problem — whether analyzing, deciding, creating, evaluating, or coaching.

## When to Use This Skill

- Solving complex or ambiguous problems
- Making high-stakes decisions under uncertainty
- Brainstorming or generating creative solutions
- Evaluating evidence, arguments, or research
- Strategic planning and competitive analysis
- Coaching or teaching structured thinking
- Diagnosing root causes of failures
- Understanding system dynamics and feedback
- Identifying and countering cognitive biases
- Designing products, services, or experiences

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Classify the Situation

Use the **Cynefin Framework** (Dave Snowden) to determine what kind of problem you're facing:

| Domain | Characteristics | Approach |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Clear** | Obvious cause-effect, best practices exist | Apply known frameworks directly |
| **Complicated** | Cause-effect requires expertise/analysis | Use analytical + strategy frameworks |
| **Complex** | No predictable cause-effect, emergent | Use systems thinking + experimentation |
| **Chaotic** | No cause-effect, crisis | Act first (OODA Loop), then stabilize |
| **Confused** | Don't know which domain you're in | Decompose the problem; gather more context |

### Step 2: Select Frameworks by Purpose

| Purpose | Best Frameworks | Reference |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| **Define the problem** | 5 Whys, Fishbone, MECE, Issue Tree, SCQA | [problem-solving.md](references/problem-solving.md) |
| **Make a decision** | Cynefin, OODA, Eisenhower, Pre-Mortem, Decision Tree | [decision-making.md](references/decision-making.md) |
| **Plan strategy** | SWOT, Five Forces, Blue Ocean, Wardley Map, Three Horizons | [strategy.md](references/strategy.md) |
| **Generate ideas** | Six Thinking Hats, SCAMPER, TRIZ, Lateral Thinking, Morphological Analysis | [creative-thinking.md](references/creative-thinking.md) |
| **Evaluate evidence** | Bayesian Updating, Falsification, Red Team, CRAAP Test | [scientific-methods.md](references/scientific-methods.md) |
| **Understand systems** | Feedback Loops, Leverage Points, Iceberg Model, Causal Loops | [systems-thinking.md](references/systems-thinking.md) |
| **Counter biases** | System 1/2, Confirmation Bias, Anchoring, Framing, Groupthink | [cognitive-biases.md](references/cognitive-biases.md) |
| **Learn & teach** | Bloom's Taxonomy, Feynman Technique, Zettelkasten, Spaced Repetition | [learning.md](references/learning.md) |
| **Design solutions** | Design Thinking, Double Diamond, Lean Startup, Kano Model | [design-innovation.md](references/design-innovation.md) |
| **Lead & change** | Radical Candor, Psychological Safety, Kotter, SCARF | [leadership.md](references/leadership.md) |
| **Communicate** | Pyramid Principle, Steel Manning, Toulmin Model, NVC | [communication.md](references/communication.md) |
| **Reason quantitatively** | Compounding, Power Laws, Margin of Safety, Fermi Estimation | [quantitative-models.md](references/quantitative-models.md) |
| **Reason about markets** | Supply/Demand, Game Theory, Incentives, Opportunity Cost | [economics.md](references/economics.md) |
| **Reason ethically** | Utilitarianism, Veil of Ignorance, Categorical Imperative, Ikigai | [ethics.md](references/ethics.md) |

### Step 3: Apply the Framework

1. **State the problem** clearly before selecting a framework
2. **Choose 2-3 complementary frameworks** — the power is in combination (Munger's Latticework principle)
3. **Walk through the framework step by step** — don't just name it, *use* it
4. **Show your reasoning** — make the framework application explicit and transparent
5. **Evaluate the output** — does the framework's output match reality? If not, try a different lens

### Step 4: Multi-Framework Analysis (Advanced)

For complex problems, stack frameworks deliberately:

```
Problem → [Classify: Cynefin] → [Diagnose: 5 Whys + Fishbone]
       → [Generate: SCAMPER + Six Hats] → [Evaluate: Pre-Mortem + Second-Order Thinking]
       → [Decide: Decision Matrix] → [Communicate: Pyramid Principle]
```
